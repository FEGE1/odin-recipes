    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Warming and full of just the right amount of spice, gingerbread cookies are the Christmas treat we never go the holiday season without. They’re equally as adorable as they are incredibly delicious: decorating these Christmas cookies is the ultimate holiday activity everyone can get involved in, creating the sweetest homemade food gift to give to friends and family.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 c. packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 c. molasses</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, and molasses until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, spices, baking soda, and salt until combined. With the mixer on low, gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, as well as  fresh ginger, orange zest, and black pepper (if using), until dough just comes together. (Do not overmix!)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half and create two discs. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 2 to 3 hours. (Alternatively, divide dough in half and roll each piece of dough between two pieces of parchment to 1/4" thick. Chill until firm.)</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Place one disc of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll until 1/4" thick. (Alternatively, peel off both sheets of parchment from dough, then replace one sheet of parchment back underneath dough.) Cut out gingerbread men with a 3" wide cutter and transfer to baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until slightly puffed and set, 9 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of your cookie cutters. Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. </li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining disc of dough. Decorate with icing and sprinkles as desired.</li>
    </ol>
