    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>On a camping trip, the classics are usually in order: s'mores, hot dogs, and baked beans. But, when we're really looking to take our trip up a notch, this campfire mac & cheese is our go-to recipe. This campfire mac & cheese is not only extra-cheesy, but loaded with crushed Ritz crackers and shredded Parmesan cheese. It's the perfect side to add to your dinner round the fire, but don't be surprised if it takes the center stage. </p>
